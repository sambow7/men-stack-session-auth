#### what is auth

- At its core, authentication is the process of verifying a user’s identity. It’s like asking, “Are you really who you claim to be?” In practical terms, this involves implementing a system where users can create an account with a username and password.

- As our applications grow more complex, with databases and relationships, it becomes vital to ensure that users can interact only with data that’s relevant to their account.

- Ternary statement ? = if...else

- Bcrypt = using the bcrypt library, we will perform what’s called a hashing operation which will scramble the user’s password into a difficult-to-decrypt string
